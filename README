BUILD AND INSTALL

First, edit Makefile to select a configuration. See comments there.

From this directory, enter:
  make install
  
It takes a few minutes. You will see this if it worked:
  Installed successfully. Enter 'ttaq' anywhere to play.
  
In the unlikely event that you decide you don't like TTAQ, do this to remove it:
  make uninstall
  
Once installed, this project directory is no longer needed.
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAVED GAME

Your progress saves automatically.
You can clear it manually:
  rm ~/.ttaq/saved-game
Or go into the "I/O" room in the southwest corner of the village.
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONTROLS

See the input config file 'etc/input' for a description of input options.
This file installs at '~/.ttaq/input'.
The defaults should be adequate for most users.

CREDITS AND COPYRIGHT

This is public domain. Use it any way you like.
It would be rude of you to make money off this without cutting me a slice.
If you reuse any of my work, I'd like to hear about it.
