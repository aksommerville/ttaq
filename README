BUILD AND INSTALL

From this directory, enter:
  make install
  
It takes a few minutes. You will see this if it worked:
  Installed successfully. Enter 'ttaq' anywhere to play.
  
Building will fail if you do not have my helper libraries "akau", "linput", "pig" and "pipng".
These are all available via sourceforge:
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/aksraspilibs/
  
In the unlikely event that you decide you don't like TTAQ, do this to remove it:
  make uninstall
  
Once installed, this project directory is no longer needed.

SAVED GAME

Your progress saves automatically.
I haven't made in-game UI for resetting it, so you have to reset it at the command line:
  rm ~/.ttaq/saved-game
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONTROLS

See the input config file 'etc/input' for a description of input options.
This file installs at '~/.ttaq/input'.
The defaults should be adequate for most users.

It would be rude of you to make money off this without cutting me a slice.
