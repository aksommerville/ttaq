BUILD AND INSTALL - BINARY

Launch from the archive's top directory (the one containing "data" and the executables).

Pick the appropriate executable:
  glx: x86, most desktop Linux installations. Requires a running X server.
  drm: x86, Linux without an X server. I run this on an Atari VCS.
  raspi1: ARM, Linux with Broadcom video, for Raspberry Pi model 1.
  raspi4: ARM, Linux with DRM, for Raspberry Pi model 4.
  
If none of those works for your system, try building from source?

Q: No Mac or Windows support?
A: It could be done, I just haven't felt the need.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUILD AND INSTALL - SOURCE

First, edit Makefile to select a configuration. See comments there.

From this directory, enter:
  make install
  
It takes a few minutes. You will see this if it worked:
  Installed successfully. Enter 'ttaq' anywhere to play.
  
In the unlikely event that you decide you don't like TTAQ, do this to remove it:
  make uninstall
  
Once installed, this project directory is no longer needed.
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAVED GAME

Your progress saves automatically.
You can clear it manually:
  rm ~/.ttaq/saved-game
Or go into the "I/O" room in the southwest corner of the village.
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONTROLS

See the input config file 'etc/input' for a description of input options.
This file installs at '~/.ttaq/input'.
The defaults should be adequate for most users.
